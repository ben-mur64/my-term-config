# My Terminal Settings

This repo comes with my bashrc, vimrc, and dircolors, as well as a bash script to install them.

Keeps my setting portable and ready to use on any new computer.

I plan on keeping this updated whenever I make changes to my configurations.

## Installation

Clone the repo, run `./install.sh`, and enter your password so it can install needed dependencies.
